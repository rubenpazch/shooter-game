# Javascript Shooter Game

Shooter game is a project built using JavaScript and the game engine [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). In order to learn how to build games with Phaser 3 and  Webpack 4 the last version I did follow some tutorials and customize a previous example for building this amazing web application, the goal of this game is to kill different enemies shooting them and after finishing the two stages get a final score compared with other players.

Webpack is used to compile JavaScript modules. Once installed, you can interface with Webpack either from its CLI or API. If you're still new to Webpack, please read through the core concepts and this comparison to learn why you might use it over the other tools that are out in the community.

## How was designed the game

This game was designed thinking on the famous movie star wars, specifically on the movie released on the year 1980 "The Empire Strikes Back", the main idea is about having a shooter and some enemies.

### Genres
  
  FPS: First-person shooters: this game build thinking in one person to be the shooter and increse his score if he is able to kill all ship enemies. 

  With that said, this is a game for one player, the only player has to move around the board and shoot as much as possible enemies, this game is supposed to have different stages, every stage will have different difficulties related with the speed of how enemies appear, how fast they move around in the board vertically, finally we have some enemies with the ability to follow the player.
  
### In-Game Terms

Difficulty: This game starts from easy and increases the difficulty on every stage, each stage increase the velocity of vertical movement and how fast these elements appear on the board.


Game Over: The player should shoot the ship enemies and as soon as the player is shooted by the enemies the game is over and he has a final score, the game can be started again at this point.

Hit Points: Every time the player shoot and enemies it counts as a point and the score increase, the final score is compared with other players to get a higher score.


Map/level: Each stage represent a different level on the game, the map does not change when the different stage is open.



### Game Mechanics 

Movement: 

This game is based on the use of the keyboard to move around the board and shoot 
The enemies using space, the player can move the ship using these keys.

- W : To move up
- S : To move down
- A : To move right 
- D : To move left

Shoot: 

For shooting the enemies the player has to press space.

Restart: 

The player can restart the game again after he is dead, this means the player was shooted or hit for an enemy.

Enemies: 

they are 3 types of enemies 
* Static enemies (Meteors) 
* shooter enemies 
* shooter enemies with the fast movement
* Enemies that follow the player until they get hit the player

### Gameplay

This game is based on stages, the player starts on the first stage, in this point, the speed of enemies are slow, on the second stage the speed increase and enemies appear faster, every enemy has the possibility to hit the player and some of them are able to shoot, the game finish when the player is shooted or hit.



* Score system: every time the player is killed, the game calculate every result and shows on the game over view wich was the higher score.

- Score system: As soon as the player is dead the game will calculate all scores and get the higher and save it for future references.
