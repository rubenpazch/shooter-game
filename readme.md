## How was designed the game

This game was designed thinking on the famous movie star wars, specifically on the movie released on the year 1980 "The Empire Strikes Back", the main idea is about having a shooter and some enemies.

### Genres
  
  FPS: First-person shooters: this game build thinking in one person to be the shooter and increse his score if he is able to kill all ship enemies. 

  With that said, this is a game for one player, the only player has to move around the board and shoot as much as possible enemies, this game is supposed to have different stages, every stage will have different difficulties related with the speed of how enemies appear, how fast they move around in the board vertically, finally we have some enemies with the ability to follow the player.
  
### In-Game Terms

Difficulty:



 Game Over: The player should shoot the ship enemies and as soon as the player is shooted by the enemies the game is over and he have a final score, the game can be restarted.


* Game Mechanics vs Gameplay
  - Movement: this game is based on the use of the keyboard to move around the board and shoot the enemies using space.
  - Shoot: for shooting the enemies the player have to press space.
  - Restart: the player can restart the game again after he is dead.
  - Enemies: they are 3 types of enemies 
    - Static enemies
    - shooter enemies
    - shooter enemies with fast movement
* Score system: every time the player is killed, the game calculate every result and shows on the game over view wich was the higher score.

- Score system: As soon as the player is dead the game will calculate all scores and get the higher and save it for future references.
