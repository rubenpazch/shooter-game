## How was designed the game

This game was designed thinking on the famous movie star wars, the main idea is about having a shooter and some enemies, we customize some existing 

* Genres
  - FPS: First-person shooters: this game build thinking in one person to be the shooter and increse his score if he is able to shoot all ship enemies.
  - Score system: As soon as the player is dead the game will calculate all scores and get the higher and save it for future references.
* In-Game Terms
  - Game Over: The player should shoot the ship enemies and as soon as the player is shooted by the enemies the game is over and he have a final score, the game can be restarted.
* Game Mechanics vs Gameplay
  - Movement: this game is based on the use of the keyboard to move around the board and shoot the enemies using space.
  - Shoot: for shooting the enemies the player have to press space.
  - Restart: the player can restart the game again after he is dead.
  - Enemies: they are 3 types of enemies 
    - Static enemies
    - shooter enemies
    - shooter enemies with fast movement
  -Score system: every time the player is killed, the game calculate every result and shows on the game over view wich was the higher score.
